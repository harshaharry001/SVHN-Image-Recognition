# SVHN-Image-Recognition

#### In this repository we are going to create a basic feed forward neural network which trains on image dataset to classify the digits as per the labels in the given dataset. Here I have chosen a basic **Sequential Model** which consists of 6 layers (1 input layer, 4 hidden layers, 1 output layer). Here I have considered the most commonly known activation function **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** which also includes *Dropout* and *Batch Normalization*. Here we have to classify the images in the dataset *(Street View House Numbers Dataset)* which have some images of house numbers which are not accuracte. I got an accuracy of around 70% which we can further optimize and increase by changing layers count, different activation functions for each layers, adding Convolution and MaxPooling filters for image reading, etc. Here is the code and dataset.
